# Module 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Overview
This project entails the creation of a run_analysis file that merges and cleans data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset. The final output is a tidy data set that has the average of each measurement variable for each activity and subject.

## Scripts
- `run_analysis.R` – Performs all steps:
  - Merges subjects, training and test sets
  - Extracts mean and std measurements
  - Applies descriptive activity names
  - Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names
  - Creates a new dataset with average values

- `tidyData.txt` – Output of the final tidy dataset.

- `CodeBook.md` – Explains each variable and the processes performed.
